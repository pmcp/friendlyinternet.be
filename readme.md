Basic homepage for friendlyinternet.be. I quickly set this up because I wanted to kickstart myself. It's a copy paste from some tinkering I did on Codepen. You can find the Pen overhere: [https://codepen.io/pmcp/pen/oLRLjv](https://codepen.io/pmcp/pen/oLRLjv).

I used [Baffle.js](https://camwiegert.github.io/baffle/), because... well, it's fun.

Will be picking this up later on, and will probably merge it with maartenlauwaert.be.
